Hi there!

Since there is not much public documentation yet we try to create one.

According with your skill level you may want to go straight for one particular topic (page file), otherwise we may recommand starting with the [basic/arduino/IDE configurations](basic/arduino/ide_configurations.md), then [basic/arduino/global variables](basic/arduino/global_variables.md) then [basic/lorawan](basic/app/LoRaWan_APP.md).

**WARNING** This is a work in progress and mostly based on the code and deduction at this stage. 
Anyone with a ASR650x could experiment and give feedback.

**WARNING** The initial author lack LoRaWAN knowledge so it could contains wording/deduction mistakes.
